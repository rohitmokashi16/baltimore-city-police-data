### Motivation
The motivation behind this proposal is to use visualization to better understand
the crime, arrests, traffic stops, and service calls to provide insight into more
effective policing for the city of Baltimore.

### Dataset Description
The crime dataset involves multiple featured attributes including incidents
dates/time, crime codes, categories, geography and location related
information. Since crime is a multifaceted and socio-economic issue, we will
join other available datasets such as census and demographic data to help in
analyzing trends in crime between neighborhoods of income inequality.

### Visualization Approaches
Several visualization techniques will be employed to thoroughly illustrate and
explore the evolutionary tendency and incident patterns spatially and temporarily.
Then, we will apply one or two technologies for the final release. Considering the geographic nature of the crime incidents, an interactive
map of Baltimore City will be used for geo-spatial visualization.
